Frontends, Inc offers a range of monsters for hire for children's or adult parties. Our monster-employees can entertain your guests with games, stories, and other activities.

The website is easy to navigate through the different categories of monsters available. You can choose from scary monsters, cute monsters, or funny monsters. Once you have made your decision, you can browse through the different options available in that category. Each monster comes with a detailed description (including its name, size, color, and any special features) and pictures, so you can see exactly what you're getting.

To place an order, we ask customers to create an account on our site. Fill in your profile - name, date of birth, address list. We will keep your information safe.

Once you have selected the monster(s) you want to hire, you can proceed to the checkout page. Here, you will be prompted to enter your event information and payment details. You will also be able to specify the date and time you want the monster(s) to arrive and depart.
